# FlightPredictor
Final project for Advanced Project Management course.

Introduction

Lots of people plan their travel through flight, and need a pragmatic and fast way to find a flight for a chosen date. Our team develops a web-based flight prediction system that leverages machine learning to forecast flight and arrival times. The platform is developed via Python as backend, frontend and prediction models developed in Jupyter Notebooks.


Problem Statement

Flight tickets vary in prices, influenced by several factors such as date of travel (weekend or holidays), demand and seasonality. Clients often struggle to find the best time to book flights at the lowest costs. Kazakhstan travelers risk overpaying without understanding price behaviour. This project addresses this problem by offering a prediction model with a flexible user interface that allows to foresee flight costs based on trends.

Objectives 

-To develop a web application that uses user input to predict the cost of airline tickets.

-To train and evaluate machine learning models on historical flight fare data.

-To offer an intuitive and engaging user interface for querying predictions.
